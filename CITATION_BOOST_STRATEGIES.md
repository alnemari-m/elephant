```

**Set goals:**
- Week 1: Complete all profiles
- Month 1: Share top 3 papers, email 10 researchers
- Month 3: Submit to conference, start blog
- Month 6: Publish review paper, organize workshop
- Year 1: +50% citations

## Expected Timeline

**Immediate (Week 1-4):**
- Profile completion: +20% visibility
- Social media sharing: +10% views
